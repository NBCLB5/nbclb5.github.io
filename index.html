            <h4>Hello, I am</h4>
            <h1>Nathan Banek</h1>
            <h2>Web Developer</h2>
            <p>I am a continuous learner with an aspiration for web development. I am in search of a team where I can
                grow and sharpen my skills with guidance from a mentor or a team of experts. Ideally, the team would be
                apart of and contribute to a positive and supportive environment where authenticity and honestly are
                harbored. This environment would be a part of an organization that is actively making changes to improve
                life as we know it and making choices to save and preserve the environment.
            </p>

            <p>Through past experiences I have had the opportunity to contribute to three overseas teams as well as four
                government agencies. I have also completed several courses and obtained a few certificates, including
                FreeCodeCamp responsive web design and AWS cloud practitioner. You can check out some of my work <a
                    href="nbclb5.github.io/Portfolio/"
                    target="_blank">here</a>. If you are a part of a team that sounds like the description above or who
                is someone who knows of such a team, please feel free to reach out to me.
            </p>

            <p>Do you want to know a little bit more about me? Well, I enjoy a good cup of coffee and I love being
                outdoors and seeing the stars or the city light. I feel at home around water whether it is by a river, a
                lake, or the ocean. I have lived aboard for close to ten years and have been to six of the seven
                continents.
                One dream of mine is to have a hobby farm and do some beekeeping one day.
            </p>

            <p>Every day, I try to live my life as positive and authentic as I can. I work hard to play hard with the
                philosophy of <em><strong>you work to live not live to work</strong></em>. If you have any questions for
                me or would like to talk about a project, you can find my contact links below. I look forward to working
                with you.
            </p>
